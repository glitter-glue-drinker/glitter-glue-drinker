## hello !!
apologies if we come off as rude or insensitive at any time, we usually dont think before saying stuff. a lot of us have bad attachment issues and a tendency to overthink quite a bit,,,


pleasepleasePLEASE be patient at times!! were sometimes very slow to process stuff or have no clue whats going on occasionally


if any of us do anything to bug you, please please please just tell us instead of getting all upset and angry at someone who probably didnt mean it


none of us mind if source of any of our fictives interact (minus a few, if "FANDOM DNI" is there its a good chance they dont want source to interact either) ! just please be wary if they have a sepcific dni, ie "dni slingshot" or "four dniuf"


please check other repositories ^_^ theres a lot of info there!!
